# Assignment: Working with Cloud Storage in Azure and GCP

- **ðŸŽ¯** This task is part of my assignment focused on familiarizing myself with cloud storage services. This repository contains codes and documentation on how I learned and gained hands-on experience uploading files to **`Azure Blob Storage`** and **`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage`** using both **`Python`** scripts and the platform's **`GUI`**.

- **ðŸ’¡** Any feedback or suggestions are welcome to improve the content of this repository.
