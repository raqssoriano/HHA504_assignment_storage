# **HHA504 || Working with Cloud Storage in Azure and GCP**

- **🎯** This task is part of my assignment focused on familiarizing myself with cloud storage services. This repository contains codes and documentation on how I learned and gained hands-on experience uploading files to **`Azure Blob Storage`** and **`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage`** using both **`Python`** scripts and the platform's **`GUI`**.

- **📝** Please refer to [**gcp_storage.py**](https://github.com/raqssoriano/HHA504_assignment_storage/blob/main/gcp_storage.py) for the python scripts, which I created using **`Python`** in **`Visual Studio Code`** to upload files/images to GCP storage.

- **💡** Any feedback or suggestions are welcome to improve the content of this repository.
